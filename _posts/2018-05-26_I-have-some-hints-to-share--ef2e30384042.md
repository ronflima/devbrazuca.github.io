I have some hints to share. You can open your source code, but you don't
need to open the entire code base. Open the components that are general,
not domain specific. In fact, opening domain-specific code is not a good
idea for several reasons and it does not have anything to do with
trademarks or patents: they are so specific that will yield useless for
other developers to reuse it.

General components, on the other hand, are not tied to a given domain
and are reusable by nature. Opening it will increase its code quality
and will create a community around it, giving some visibility to your
business as a tech provider.

Anyways, good luck with Taylor. Anyone can be hacked these days and
building a business is a hard task at these turbulent times.
