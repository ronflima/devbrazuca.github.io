I respectfully disagree. Knowing a programming language don't make
yourself a programmer, in the same way that knowing English don't make
yourself a writer. It depends a lot on what you are seeking. If one want
to be a professional programmer, a programming language is only one tiny
part of the desired knwledge. It is important to understand algorithms,
analysis and data modeling, and a lot of other disciplines besides a
programming language (programming paradigms, design patterns only to
name a few) .

It is very common to find programmers in the field that know their
programming language profoundly, but lack knowledge on how to do
object-oriented programming, even procedural programming. Also, it is
common to see bad coding practices, bad logic, high coupling and bad use
of third-party dependencies.

Yes, javascript is very simple and great to start with. It is part of
automation tools on several operating systems (Windows have WSH, macOS
have its scripting layer). But knowing only javascript doesn't make one
a programmer.
