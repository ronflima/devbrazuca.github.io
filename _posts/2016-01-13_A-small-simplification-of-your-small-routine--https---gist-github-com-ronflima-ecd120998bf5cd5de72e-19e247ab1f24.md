A small simplification of your small routine:

This one avoids declaring an extra variable, which saves a small amount
of memory on stack. Actually, this version is less readable comparing
with yours.

In fact your version is better because of its readability. It is
preferrable to have better readability than to have an optimized code.
Optimization should be used only if you really need it.
